TODO
====
[ ] redo localization entirely
[ ] rethink rate limiting, maybe using CRLF protection?
[ ] refactor run_selector (base.js) and update_[...]() (component.etlua)
[ ] caching
[ ] remake API for Snap! editor
[ ] IMPORTANT! Make sure _ONLY_ the necessary data is pulled from the DB and
    stored into the component data. As it is, pulling a collection also pulls
    its creator, and along with the creator we get their (hashed, but still...)
    password, email, etc. Inspecting the page source would reveal all this info.
    IDEA: Use an after_filter?
[-] collection info
    [x] mark as free-for-all

[ ] collection editors
    [ ] remove editor
    [x] add editor
[-] collection project controls

TODO AFTER DEPLOYING
====================
[ ] project

    [ ] edit title
[ ] profile partial could be made a component so it can be updated on the fly
